Here is the **10,000-Feet System Summary** in table and bullet format.

# ðŸ“˜ System Overview: **Event Role Assignment Model (First Draft)**

### âœ… Core Tables

| Table Name          | Purpose                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `users`             | Stores all user accounts                   |
| `events`            | Stores all event records                   |
| `event_permissions` | Links users to events with a specific role |

### âœ… `event_permissions` Table Structure

| Column       | Type      | Description                               |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | Integer   | Primary key                               |
| `user_id`    | Integer   | References `users.id`                     |
| `event_id`   | Integer   | References `events.id`                    |
| `role`       | String    | `"manager"` / `"supervisor"` (extendable) |
| `created_at` | Timestamp | Optional; for audit or tracking           |

### âœ… System Behavior Summary

I. **Each user** can be assigned to multiple events with different roles.
II. **Each event** can have multiple assigned users, each with a unique role.
III. `event_permissions` acts as a **join table + role definition** in one.
IV. Enables:

* User dashboards (all assigned events + roles)
* Event dashboards (all assigned users per role)
* Permission checks (e.g., only managers can edit)
* Scalable filtering and role-based access

---

### âœ… Design Benefits

I. Clean many-to-many mapping with role metadata
II. Easy to extend with more roles (`reviewer`, `editor`, etc.)
III. Centralized logic for permissions and assignments
IV. Minimal duplication; full visibility from both user and event sides
