Dear CEO North West,

Thank you for your prompt and thorough feedback. I’ve distilled the Excel sheet into a concise overview:

• 27 Business Events in total  
• 126 Data Items across those events

What We Have Now
1. A master list of all Business Events we need to capture
2. A catalog of each Data Item to be recorded at each event

Next: Deep Dive into Event-Level Data
1. Source & Ownership  
   – Does this require its own table or a pre-defined picklist?  
2. Numeric Constraints  
   – Are there upper/lower bounds or valid ranges?  
3. Formatting Rules  
   – Specific patterns (e.g., truck number formats)  
4. Supporting Documents  
   – For items like Bill of Lading or GD Certificate, gather blank templates to start our Business Library

Note: I have annotated the first two events’ Data Items with comments to clarify the exact information we need.

Why This Matters  
Event-level data is the foundation of our entire system. If we get these details right, the rest of the workflow will follow seamlessly—and this documentation will form the core of our future AI workflow.
